    <MudExpansionPanel Text="Can I trust PhishSceptic?">
        PhishSceptic is designed to help you identify phishing emails. However, just because PhishSceptic does not flag anything as suspicious in the email, it does not necessarily mean it can be trusted, and vice versa. PhishSceptic's main aim is to encourage you to be sceptical and use your own intuitions.
        It is important to note that no one indicator can definitively identify a phishing email, and a combination of these indicators should be used to make an informed decision.
